# Stock Broking Web Application

![Project Image](https://your-image-link.com)

A web application built with Next.js for a stock and ETF broking website. This application includes two main pages: Explore and Product Page, a common header, and a search bar. It fetches data from the [Financial Modeling Prep API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/) to provide information about stocks and ETFs.

## Project Overview

This web application allows users to explore stock and ETF information. It includes the following key features:

- **Explore Page:** Contains two tabs for Top Gainers and Losers. Each tab displays a grid of cards, each representing a stock or ETF. Users can click on a card to navigate to the Product Page for more details.

- **Product Page:** Displays detailed information about a selected stock or ETF, including basic data and a line graph of price changes.

- **Common Header:** The header is present on both pages and provides the application's name and a search bar. The search bar provides suggested stocks as the user types.

The application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes. It uses state management to handle loading, error, and empty state scenarios effectively. Additionally, it caches API responses to improve performance and responsiveness.

Certainly, here's the updated section with the correct information:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-broking-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stock-broking-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create an environment variable to store your API key. You can obtain a free API key from [Financial Modeling Prep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/) by signing up on their website. Once you have your API key, store it in your project's environment variables.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Note:** To access the API endpoints, you'll need an API key from [Financial Modeling Prep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/). If the site's data cards are not available, you can generate a new API key from the site after signing up. This API key should be stored securely in your project's environment variables. The decision to use this site is based on having a higher rate limit, making it suitable for development and testing purposes.

## Program Design

The program is designed as a single-page application (SPA) using Next.js. It consists of multiple components that are structured into a well-defined folder structure. Key components include:

- **ExplorePage:** Displays the top gainers and losers, featuring grids of cards representing stocks and ETFs. Clicking on a card routes the user to the Product Page for that item.

- **ProductPage:** Provides detailed information about a selected stock or ETF, including basic data and a line graph of price changes.

- **Header:** A common header that appears on both pages, displaying the application name and a search bar.

- **SearchBar:** Part of the Header, it shows suggested stocks as the user types.

The use of a responsive design ensures that the application adapts to various screen sizes. Additionally, state management libraries (e.g., Redux) are used to handle loading, error, and empty state scenarios efficiently. Caching API responses with expiration improves performance.

## Technologies

- **Next.js:** The framework used for building the SPA.
- **React:** The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Financial Modeling Prep API:** Provides stock and ETF data.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling.
- **Chart.js:** A library for creating interactive charts.
- **State Management:** The chosen state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Jotai).
- **Caching:** To cache API responses with expiration for responsiveness.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the Financial Modeling Prep API.

## Features

- Explore top gainers and losers in the stock and ETF market.
- Detailed information about individual stocks and ETFs.
- Real-time stock suggestions as you type in the search bar.
- Responsive design for a seamless user experience on various devices.
- Efficiently handle loading, error, and empty state scenarios.
- Caching of API responses for improved performance.
- A well-structured folder hierarchy for easy code maintenance.
